Welcome to TuneQuest, a music guessing game that will put your music knowledge to the test! 
Inspired by the board game Hitster, TuneQuest brings the excitement and challenge of guessing iconic tracks right to your table.
Are you a music aficionado? A casual listener? Or just someone who loves a good challenge? TuneQuest has something for everyone. 
With the whole Spotify library to choose from, there's always a new challenge awaiting you.
How well do you know your favorite artists' discographies? 
Can you pinpoint the exact year that legendary albums were released? 
TuneQuest will push your memory and musical knowledge to the limit as you compete against friends or test your skills solo.

## Important Notes

Due to the Spotify API restrictions, the game can only be played by users with a Spotify Premium account.
Also due to the nature of web browsers in general, the first scanned song may not play automatically and you may have to click on the play button to start the song.
This is a feature of the web browsers to prevent autoplaying of media content that is often times unwanted by the user.

# TODO
- [ ] Add compatibility with the original Hitster cards
  - This is a painstaking process, as the original Hitster cards are not available online and I have to manually type them in.
  - I will start with the cards I own and if you want to help me, please let me know.
- [ ] Add better error handling
- [ ] Improve the Docker Image to not bake in some of the environment variables
- [ ] Publish Docker image to Docker Hub
  - If someone wants to help me with this, please let me know.
